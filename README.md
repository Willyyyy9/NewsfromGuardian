## Description

News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.
The user is able to enter a keyword or a name that would relate to a type of article or a person an article is related to him and 
the app will bring the user those articles.<br/>
When the user clicks on the article shwoing in the app, it will direct him to read the article from the website of the Guardian.
The open-source [Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/) is used in this app.
 

This project is about combining various ideas and skills including:
* Connecting to an API.
* Parsing the response of the API.
* Updating information regularly.
* Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle. <br/>
